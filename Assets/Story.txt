In the year of 0x9C8 the great war between the leaders of the earth has raged for centuries. 
The horrible tyrants Adolf Pixler, Benito Pixelini and Kim Jonp-ixel had sacrificed Peta-bytes of innocent pixels in their fight for world domination.

The only hope left for pixel-kind was the brave soldiers of the United Pixels. They put all their resources towards the great quantum eraser project.
The United Pixels gathered all the greatest quantum physicist to create the ultimate weapon. The idea was to create the most dangerous stealth warriors the world had ever seen. But something went wrong.

In the process of creating the ultimate camouflage the test subjects were also quantum entangled and all research was destroyed. 
Only the two brave soldiers who had volunteered for the experiment survived the sub-pixel quantified forces set free. 
Despite the mishap the United Pixels decided to send out these soldiers to eliminate the enemies of peace and erase all evil from the world.
